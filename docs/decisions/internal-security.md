# Should we use TLS for communication between internal services (behind the reverse proxy)?

## Context and Problem Statement

[Current recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Microservices_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#mutual-transport-layer-security) for microservice architectures recommend the use of Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) for communication between all internal services.

TLS provides two levels of protection:

1. Data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted
2. By signing data with a private key the server / client can prove they are who they say they are

This stops malicious actors from monitoring unencrypted communication and prevents "man in the middle" attacks, where a rogue system impersonates the intended server / client.

However, this kind of deployment can be complicated and generally requires some kind of Service Mesh when deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. However, we might want to consider using TLS internally when communicating with servers containing sensitive information, such as Keycloak.

## Decision Drivers

* Security should be good enough for our domain
* Approach should not have a significant impact on performance
* It needs to be easy to develop and test

## Considered Options

* Use unsecured communication internally, terminating TLS at the reverse proxy
* Sensitive services require TLS internally, with a different certificate from the public one
* Sensitive services require TLS internally, with the same certificate as the public one

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | â€¦ | comes out best (see below)}.

### Consequences

{Provide detail on the implications of making this decision and how any forseen problems can be mitigated}

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is confirmed. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test.
 Although we classify this element as optional, it is included in most ADRs.}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use unsecured communication internally

This matches the current model, where unsecured communication is used internally, with TLS terminated at then nginx reverse proxy. Communication between networks is carried out over SSH tunnels.

* Good: Matches current deployment model
* Good: No need to use TLS during development
* Bad: The authenticity of the intended recipient is not guaranteed, allowing "man in the middle" attacks if the infrastructure has been compromised
* Bad: Internal communication is not encrypted so can be monitored if a bad actor gets network access

### Use SSL with internal certificates

In this case we would use our own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to issue internal certificates for any services that require TLS. Any clients needing access to these services would need to trust our internal Certificate Authority (CA).

* Good: Prevents basic "man in the middle" and network monitoring
* Good: Private keys for public certificates only need to be deployed to the reverse proxy
* Bad: Traffic would need to be re-encrypted at the reverse proxy, adding some latency
* Bad: Requires developers to use TLS internal for accurate integration testing
* Bad: Need to implement mechanisms to renew certificates

### Use SSL with public certificates

In this case we would use the public certificates for sensitive services for internal communication too. This would require internal DNS configuration to ensure that external host names can also be used internally.

* Good: Prevents basic "man in the middle" and network monitoring
* Good: Reverse proxy can operate in pass through mode avoiding re-encryption
* Good: Private keys for public certificates only need to be deployed to target service
* Bad: Not possible to log request information on the reverse proxy
* Bad: Need to implement mechanisms to renew certificates on each service
* Bad: Requires developers to use TLS internal for accurate integration testing
* Bad: Not suitable for services that do not need to be exposed externally
